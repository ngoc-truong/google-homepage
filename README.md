# Google Homepage (Difficult Version)

In this practice project, I recreated the google search page (using the search term "Build this website"). In this project, I recap HTML and CSS skills, mainly how to position elements with CSS grids. 

In addition I tried to replicate the search page as accurate as possible, including using Aweseome Fonts for the icons. 

This project is part of the Odin Project curriculum.
